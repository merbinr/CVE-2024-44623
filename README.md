# CVE-2024-44623
In [SPX-GC](https://github.com/TuomoKu/SPX-GC) 1.3.0v and below versions, user controlled input was passed in exec function of child_process module with out any sanitization leads to blind remote code execution.

## Vulnerability
In [/routes/routes-api.js](https://github.com/TuomoKu/SPX-GC/blob/65f284f4b9dad4e8c694dd9de0086238c4f7d2b9/routes/routes-api.js#L37-L39), user input recieved from file param and passed into exec function of child_process leads to blind RCE

### Blind RCE
Blind Remote Code Execution (RCE) in web applications occurs when an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a server without immediate feedback or direct knowledge of the results. This vulnerability often arises from improper handling of user input and can be exploited through mechanisms like command execution.
